Hardcaml Xilinx
===============

The Hardcaml_xilinx library provides wrappers for Xilinx specific RAM
and FIFO primitive blocks.  In many cases a simulation model is provided.

The `Synthesis` module provides a number of RTL components implemented
directly from low level LUT primitives. It implements the full
Hardcaml `Comb.S` signature and can be used to implement highly custom
Xilinx circuits.
